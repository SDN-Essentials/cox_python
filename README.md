Cox Python Challenge

Requirements:
* Copy main.py into your package and run using `python main.py`

* The output from the code needs to print `Excellent` meaning that the routes() method must returned a normalized routing table from each device

* Follow the lab guide 8 for guidance on how to structure your package

* You may reuse any code from Chuck

* You will likely need to update util.py (i.e. there are issues preventing you from making this work)

* You may ommit `age` from the routing table

* Most of the work will be fixing the function that normalizes the function in the routing table retrieved from CLI
